# Genetic_Algorithm
This is a Python implementation of a genetic algorithm that simulates natural evolution to find optimal solutions to problems.

## Features
- Population-based optimization using genetic operators
- Selection, crossover and mutation operations
- Configurable parameters like population size, mutation rate, etc.
- Fitness function customization for different problems
- Visualization of fitness improvement over generations

## Requirements
- Python 3.12+
- deap>=1.4.2
- matplotlib>=3.10.1 (for visualization)
- numpy>=2.2.5
- openpyxl>=3.1.5
- pandas>=2.2.3

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Khaled-Abbas-1/Genetic_Algorithm.git
cd genetic_algorithm
uv pip install -r <(uv pip compile pyproject.toml)
```
